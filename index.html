      <h3>Premier League Weekend Roundup</h3>
      <p>
        This past Premier League weekend delivered everything ‚Äî goals, drama, and a major shake-up at the top and bottom of the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting with Chelsea, the Blues showed flashes of their old dominance with a confident 5-0 demolition of West Ham at Stamford Bridge. Cole Palmer was once again the heartbeat of the attack, adding another goal to his already stellar campaign, while Noni Madueke and Nicolas Jackson stepped up with sharp runs and clinical finishes. For a team that's been heavily criticized this season, this win felt like a statement ‚Äî not just of attacking quality, but of intent going into the final stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Arsenal continue to apply pressure at the top after dismantling Wolves 3-0 with a display of organized chaos and precise pressing. Mikel Arteta‚Äôs side look composed, confident, and very much in control of their title charge. Liverpool, on the other hand, dropped critical points at Craven Cottage in a frustrating 2-2 draw with Fulham. Questions will be asked about their midfield control and the inconsistency that‚Äôs crept into their form at the worst possible time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Manchester City handled their business like the machine they are ‚Äî a comfortable 4-1 win over Leeds, with Erling Haaland back among the goals and Kevin De Bruyne running the show. Pep Guardiola‚Äôs men are once again showing why they're the most feared team in the league when momentum hits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further down the table, the relegation battle is heating up. Nottingham Forest‚Äôs shock win over Brighton could prove season-defining, while Burnley continue to struggle to put points on the board. The intensity is rising week by week ‚Äî and next weekend‚Äôs fixtures are looking even more unpredictable.
      </p>
      <p>
        That‚Äôs all from this week's roundup. Tune in to The Chill Lounge for raw reactions, debates, and vibes as we break down all the action, banter about your team‚Äôs chances, and get real about who‚Äôs got that dog in them üî•üêï
